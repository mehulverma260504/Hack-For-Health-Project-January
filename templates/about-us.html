    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>The envisioned project holds significant value in the medical domain. It proposes the development of a machine
        learning-driven web application dedicated to medical diagnostics. The project entails the creation of a machine
        learning model, seamlessly integrated into the web application, enabling users to upload their medical data for
        analysis. The application will employ the developed machine learning model to detect health diseases.
        Subsequently, users can schedule appointments with doctors through the web application if they seek professional
        advice. Additionally, a chat (email) feature will facilitate communication between patients and doctors within
        the platform.</p>

    <h2>Why this Project?</h2>
    <p>While humans are prone to errors, machines are not, and their predicted outcomes can be assessed for accuracy
        through machine learning. Bearing this in mind, extensive research was conducted in the realms of allopathic,
        homeopathic, and ayurvedic data. Due to the limited availability of research papers for patient datasets in
        homeopathy and ayurvedic medicine, the decision was made to utilize allopathic datasets accessible on platforms
        such as Kaggle and the UCI machine learning portals.</p>

    <h2>Technical aspect</h2>
    <p>This webapp was developed using Flask Web Framework. The models used to predict the diseases were trained on
        large Datasets. All the links for datasets and the python notebooks used for model creation are mentioned below
        in this readme. The webapp can predict following Diseases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Diabetes</li>
        <li>Breast Cancer</li>
        <li>Heart Disease</li>
        <li>Kidney Disease</li>
        <li>Liver Disease</li>
        <li>Malaria</li>
    </ul>
